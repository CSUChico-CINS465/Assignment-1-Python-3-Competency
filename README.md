# Assignment #1: Learning Python 3

For this assignment, the goal is for you to work through solving a variety of problems and gain some proficiency in programming in Python3. To this end I'm going to have you leverage [HackerRank's](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) Python Language Profiency set of challenges to learn Python3 language features and validate your success. 

## Your Task

Your task is to get the 3 star silver Python language proficency badge on HackerRank. There are a number of decent problems to give you hands on practice with a multitude of Python language features, which will be helpful as we move forward to using Python to interact with web technologies or you use it beyond this class in other applications.

### Partial Credit

Your grade on the assignment will be as follows if you don't get to the 3 star silver but complete the earlier badges. 

* 1 star bronze - 30%
* 2 star bronze - 70% 

### Extra Credit

You will get extra credit of 10 points for each additional badge level you earn beyond the 3 star silver.

## Submitting proof

If you haven't already create your CINS465 repo through the form on my website, you'll need the GitHub Token given out in lecture to do so.

### Proofs

I'll need three things to be submitted for you to get credit for this assignment, which you will put into your CINS465 repo and if it makes things easier you can put into an *assigment1* folder: 

* Will need a screenshot of your account settings with your username and school email in the screenshot, which should like below:

* Will need a screenshot of your profile with your username and the badge to confirm you earned the badge. Make sure your username and badge are both captured like below:

* Lastly, include a *README.md* file with the above screenshots with a list of the hackerrank challenges you solved to earn the badge. This can be a formmated in markdown list of the names of the challenges or a list of links to the challenges. If you don't know markdown, you can also just put each challenge on a seperate line. This is to help me determine some insight into what challenges you solved.

### Putting proof onto GitHub

The competency proofs should be submitted to your CINS465 repo on a branch named **assignment1**, make sure your case is identical for your branch or I may not find/grade your submission. To do this you can do the following in your repo directory, it assumes you want to add all the code in the directory:

```
git checkout -b assignment1 #create branch and switch to it
git add -A #add all
git commit -m "Assignment 1 Submission" #Commit changes to branch
git push origin assignment1 #Push code up to assignment2 branch on remote
```
