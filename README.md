# Assignment #1: Learning Python 3

For this assignment, the goal is for you to work through solving a variety of problems and gain some proficiency in programming in Python3. To this end I'm going to have you leverage [HackerRank's](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) Python Language Profiency set of challenges to learn Python3 language features and validate your success. 

## Your Task





## Submitting code

If you haven't already create your CINS465 repo through the form on my website, you'll need the GitHub Token given out in lecture to do so.

The competency proofs should be submitted to your CINS465 repo on a branch named **assignment1**, make sure your case is identical for your branch or I may not find/grade your submission. To do this you can do the following in your repo directory, it assumes you want to add all the code in the directory:

```
git checkout -b assignment1 #create branch and switch to it
git add -A #add all
git commit -m "Assignment 1 Submission" #Commit changes to branch
git push origin assignment1 #Push code up to assignment2 branch on remote
```
